# GPIO-Driver
 This repository provides a demonstration of a GPIO (General Purpose Input/Output) driver tailored for STM32 microcontrollers. With a focus on simplicity and clarity, this demonstration offers insights into embedded C programming and microcontroller peripheral configuration within the constraints of STM32F4 boards.
